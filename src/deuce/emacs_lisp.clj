  "Specify a way of parsing arguments for interactive use of a function.
  For example, write
   (defun foo (arg buf) \"Doc string\" (interactive \"P\\nbbuffer: \") .... )
   to make ARG be the raw prefix argument, and set BUF to an existing buffer,
   when `foo' is called as a command.
  The \"call\" to `interactive' is actually a declaration rather than a function;
   it tells `call-interactively' how to read arguments
   to pass to the function.
  When actually called, `interactive' just returns nil.

  Usually the argument of `interactive' is a string containing a code letter
   followed optionally by a prompt.  (Some code letters do not use I/O to get
   the argument and do not use prompts.)  To get several arguments, concatenate
   the individual strings, separating them by newline characters.
  Prompts are passed to format, and may use % escapes to print the
   arguments that have already been read.
  If the argument is not a string, it is evaluated to get a list of
   arguments to pass to the function.
  Just `(interactive)' means pass no args when calling interactively.

  Code letters available are:
  a -- Function name: symbol with a function definition.
  b -- Name of existing buffer.
  B -- Name of buffer, possibly nonexistent.
  c -- Character (no input method is used).
  C -- Command name: symbol with interactive function definition.
  d -- Value of point as number.  Does not do I/O.
  D -- Directory name.
  e -- Parameterized event (i.e., one that's a list) that invoked this command.
       If used more than once, the Nth `e' returns the Nth parameterized event.
       This skips events that are integers or symbols.
  f -- Existing file name.
  F -- Possibly nonexistent file name.
  G -- Possibly nonexistent file name, defaulting to just directory name.
  i -- Ignored, i.e. always nil.  Does not do I/O.
  k -- Key sequence (downcase the last event if needed to get a definition).
  K -- Key sequence to be redefined (do not downcase the last event).
  m -- Value of mark as number.  Does not do I/O.
  M -- Any string.  Inherits the current input method.
  n -- Number read using minibuffer.
  N -- Numeric prefix arg, or if none, do like code `n'.
  p -- Prefix arg converted to number.  Does not do I/O.
  P -- Prefix arg in raw form.  Does not do I/O.
  r -- Region: point and mark as 2 numeric args, smallest first.  Does no I/O.
  s -- Any string.  Does not inherit the current input method.
  S -- Any symbol.
  U -- Mouse up event discarded by a previous k or K argument.
  v -- Variable name: symbol that is user-variable-p.
  x -- Lisp expression read but not evaluated.
  X -- Lisp expression read and evaluated.
  z -- Coding system.
  Z -- Coding system, nil if no prefix arg.

  In addition, if the string begins with `*', an error is signaled if
    the buffer is read-only.
  If `@' appears at the beginning of the string, and if the key sequence
   used to invoke the command includes any mouse events, then the window
   associated with the first of those events is selected before the
   command is run.
  If the string begins with `^' and `shift-select-mode' is non-nil,
   Emacs first calls the function `handle-shift-selection'.
  You may use `@', `*', and `^' together.  They are processed in the
   order that they appear, before reading any arguments."
